"""Module throttle.

========
Throttle
========

You can use the Throttle class or the @throttle decorator to limit the
number of requests made during a specific interval. Many online services
state a limit as to how many requests can be made per some time interval.
For example, "no more than one request per second", or maybe something like
"no more than 30 requests each minute". The @throttle decorator wraps a
method that makes requests to ensure that the the limit is not exceeded. The
@throttle keeps track of the time for each request and will insert a wait
(via time.sleep()) as needed to stay within the limit. Note that the
Throttle class provides the same service to allow you to use the throttle
where a decorator is not the optimal choice. Following are examples of using
both the @throttle decorator and the Throttle class methods.

:Example: use @throttle decorator for a limit of one request per second

In the example code below, in the first iteration, the @throttle
decorator code will see that there are no requests that have been made within
the last second and will allow the request to proceed. For each subsequent
call, the @throttle code will delay via time.sleep for approximately 0.9
seconds before allowing the request to proceed. This will ensure that the
limit is not exceeded.

>>> from scottbrian_utils.throttle import Throttle
>>> import time
>>> @throttle(requests=1, seconds=1, mode=Throttle.MODE_SYNC)
>>> def make_request():
...     time.sleep(.1)  # simulate request that takes 1/10 second
>>> for i in range(100):
...     make_request()


:Example: use Throttle methods for a limit of one request per second

In the example code below, each call to send_request passes the request
funtion and its args. For the first iteration, send_request will see that
there are no requests that have been made within the last second and will
call the request function without delay. For each subsequent call,
send_request will delay via time.sleep for approximately 0.9
seconds before allowing the request to proceed. This will ensure that the
limit is not exceeded.

>>> from scottbrian_utils.throttle import Throttle
>>> import time
>>> def my_request(idx, *, life):
...     print(f'my_request entered with idx {idx}, and life is {life}')
>>> request_throttle = Throttle(requests=1, seconds=1, mode=Throttle.MODE_SYNC)
>>> for i in range(3):
...     request_throttle.send_request(my_req, i, life='good')
my_request entered with idx 1, and life is good
my_request entered with idx 1, and life is good
my_request entered with idx 1, and life is good

Example: use @throttle decorator for a limit of 20 requests per minute with the
         early count algorithm

In this example, we are allowing up to 20 requests per minute. In this case
the @throttle decorator code will allow the first 20 requests to go through
without waiting. When the 21st request is made, the @throttle code will wait to
ensure we remain within the limit. More specifically, with each request being
made approximately every .1 seconds, the first 20 request took approximately 2
seconds. Thus, @throttle code will wait for 58 seconds before allowing the
21st request to proceed.

>>> from scottbrian_utils.throttle import Throttle
>>> import time
>>> @throttle(requests=20, seconds=60, mode=Throttle.MODE_SYNC_EC,
...           early_count=20)
>>> def make_request():
...     time.sleep(.1)  # simulate request that takes 1/10 second
>>> for i in range(21):
...     make_request()


As can be seen with the above example, we were able to allow a burst of
20 requests and still remain within the limit (i.e., if the service in
stating no more thna 20 requests per minutes is OK with getting a burst of
20 each minute). Uing mode Throttle.MODE_ASYNC or Throttle.MODE_SYNC without
the early count algorithm will simply delay the requests by a uniform 3
seconds each to ensure we remain with the 60 second limit for 20 requests.

The throttle module contains:

    1) Throttle class with methods:

       a. send_request
       b. start_shutdown
    2) Error exception classes:

       a. IncorrectNumberRequestsSpecified
       b. IncorrectPerSecondsSpecified
    3) @throttle decorator

        Args:
            requests: The number of requests that can be made in
                        the interval specified by seconds.
            seconds: The number of seconds in which the number of requests
                       specified in requests can be made.
            mode: Specifies one of four modes for the throttle:

                1) **mode=Throttle.MODE_ASYNC** specifies asynchronous mode.
                   With asynchoneous throttling,
                   each request is placed on a queue and control returns
                   to the caller. A separate thread then executes each
                   request at a steady interval to acheieve the specified
                   number of requests per the specified number of seconds.
                   Since the caller is given back control, any return
                   values from the request must be handled by an
                   established protocol between the caller and the request,
                   (e.g., a callback method).
                2) **mode=Throttle.MODE_SYNC** specifies synchonous mode.
                   For synchronous throttling, the caller may be blocked to
                   delay the request in order to achieve the specified
                   number of requests per the specified number of seconds.
                   Since the request is handled synchronously, a return
                   value from the request will be returned to the caller
                   when the request completes.
                3) **mode=Throttle.MODE_SYNC_EC** specifies synchronous mode
                   using an early arrival algorithm.
                   For synchronous throttleing with the early
                   arrival algorithm, some number of requests are sent
                   immediatly without delay even though they may have
                   arrived at a quicker pace than that allowed by the
                   the requests and seconds specification. An early_count
                   specification is required when mode
                   Throttle.MODE_SYNC_EC
                   is specified. See the early_count parameter for details.
                4) **mode=Throttle.MODE_SYNC_LB** specifies synchronous mode
                   using a leaky bucket algorithm.
                   For synchronous throttleing with the leaky bucket
                   algorithm, some number of requests are sent
                   immediatly without delay even though they may have
                   arrived at a quicker pace than that allowed by the
                   the requests and seconds specification. A
                   lb_threshold specification is required when mode
                   Throttle.MODE_SYNC_LB is specified. See the
                   lb_threshold parameter for details.
            async_q_size: Specifies the size of the request
                            queue for async requests. When the request
                            queue is totaly populated, any additional
                            calls to send_request will be delayed
                            until queued requests are removed and
                            scheduled. The default is 4096 requests.
            early_count: Specifies the number of requests that are allowed
                           to proceed that arrive earlier than the
                           allowed interval. The count of early requests
                           is incremented, and when it exceeds the
                           early_count, the request will be delayed to
                           align it with its expected arrival time. Any
                           request that arrives at or beyond the
                           allowed interval will cause the count to be
                           reset (included the request that was delayed
                           since it will now be sent at the allowed interval).
                           A specification of zero for the early_count will
                           effectively cause all requests that are early to
                           be delayed.
            lb_threshold: Specifies the threshold for the leaky bucket when
                            Throttle.MODE_SYNC_LB is specified for mode.
                            This is the number of requests that can be in
                            the bucket such that the next request is allowed
                            to proceed without delay. That request is
                            added to the bucket, and then the bucket leaks
                            out the requests. When the next request arrives,
                            it will be delayed by whatever amount of time is
                            needed for the bucket to have leaked enough to be
                            at the threshold. A specification of zero for the
                            lb_threshold will effectively cause all requests
                            that are early to be delayed.

    """Decorator to wrap a function in a throttle to avoid exceeding a limit.

    The throttle wraps code around a function that is typically used to issue
    requests to an online service. Some services state a limit as to how
    many requests can be made per some time interval (e.g., 3 requests per
    second). The throttle code ensures that the limit is not exceeded.

    Args:
        wrapped: Any callable function that accepts optional positional
                   and/or optional keyword arguments, and optionally returns a
                   value. The default is None, which will be the case when
                   the pie decorator version is used with any of the following
                   arguments specified.
        requests: The number of requests that can be made in
                    the interval specified by seconds.
        seconds: The number of seconds in which the number of requests
                   specified in requests can be made.
        mode: Specifies one of four modes for the throttle:

            1) **mode=Throttle.MODE_ASYNC** specifies asynchronous mode.
               With asynchoneous throttling,
               each request is placed on a queue and control returns
               to the caller. A separate thread then executes each
               request at a steady interval to acheieve the specified
               number of requests per the specified number of seconds.
               Since the caller is given back control, any return
               values from the request must be handled by an
               established protocol between the caller and the request,
               (e.g., a callback method).
            2) **mode=Throttle.MODE_SYNC** specifies synchonous mode.
               For synchronous throttling, the caller may be blocked to
               delay the request in order to achieve the the specified
               number of requests per the specified number of seconds.
               Since the request is handled synchronously on the same
               thread, any return value from the request will be
               immediately returned to the caller when the request
               completes.
            3) **mode=Throttle.MODE_SYNC_EC** specifies synchronous mode
               using an early arrival algorithm.
               For synchronous throttleing with the early
               arrival algorithm, some number of requests are sent
               immediatly without delay even though they may have
               arrived at a quicker pace than that allowed by the
               the requests and seconds specification. An early_count
               specification is required when mode Throttle.MODE_SYNC_EC
               is specified. See the early_count parameter for details.
            4) **mode=Throttle.MODE_SYNC_LB** specifies synchronous mode
               using a leaky bucket algorithm.
               For synchronous throttleing with the leaky bucket
               algorithm, some number of requests are sent
               immediatly without delay even though they may have
               arrived at a quicker pace than that allowed by the
               the requests and seconds specification. A
               lb_threshold specification is required when mode
               Throttle.MODE_SYNC_LB is specified. See the
               lb_threshold parameter for details.

        async_q_size: Specifies the size of the request
                        queue for async requests. When the request
                        queue is totaly populated, any additional
                        calls to send_request will be delayed
                        until queued requests are removed and
                        scheduled. The default is 4096 requests.
        early_count: Specifies the number of requests that are allowed
                       to proceed that arrive earlier than the
                       allowed interval. The count of early requests
                       is incremented, and when it exceeds the
                       early_count, the request will be delayed to
                       align it with its expected arrival time. Any
                       request that arrives at or beyond the
                       allowed interval will cause the count to be
                       reset (included the request that was delayed
                       since it will now be sent at the allowed interval).
                       A specification of zero for the early_count will
                       effectively cause all requests that are early to
                       be delayed.
        lb_threshold: Specifies the threshold for the leaky bucket when
                        Throttle.MODE_SYNC_LB is specified for mode.
                        This is the number of requests that can be in
                        the bucket such that the next request is allowed
                        to proceed without delay. That request is
                        added to the bucket, and then the bucket leaks
                        out the requests. When the next request arrives,
                        it will be delayed by whatever amount of time is
                        needed for the bucket to have leaked enough to be
                        at the threshold. A specification of zero for the
                        lb_threshold will effectively cause all requests
                        that are early to be delayed.

    Returns:
        A callable function that, for mode Throttle.MODE_ASYNC, queues the

    # ========================================================================
    #  The following code covers cases where throttle is used with or without
    #  the pie character, where the decorated function has or does not have
    #  parameters.
    #
    #     Here's an example of throttle with a function that has no args:
    #         @throttle(requests=1, seconds=1, mode=Throttle.MODE_SYNC)
    #         def aFunc():
    #             print('42')
    #
    #     This is what essentially happens under the covers:
    #         def aFunc():
    #             print('42')
    #         aFunc = throttle(requests=1,
    #                          seconds=1,
    #                          mode=Throttle.MODE_SYNC)(aFunc)
    #
    #     The call to throttle results in a function being returned that takes
    #     as its first argument the aFunc specification that we see in parens
    #     immediately following the throttle call.
    #
    #     Note that we can also code the above as shown and get the same
    #     result.
    #
    #     Also, we can code the following and get the same result:
    #         def aFunc():
    #             print('42')
    #         aFunc = throttle(aFunc,
    #                          requests=1,
    #                          seconds=1,
    #                          mode=Throttle.MODE_SYNC)
    #
    #     What happens is throttle gets control and tests whether aFunc
    #     was specified, and if not returns a call to functools.partial
    #     which is the function that accepts the aFunc
    #     specification and then calls throttle with aFunc as the first
    #     argument with the other args for requests, seconds, and mode).
    #
    #     One other complication is that we are also using the wrapt.decorator
    #     for the inner wrapper function which does some more smoke and
    #     mirrors to ensure introspection will work as expected.

    """Shutdown the throttle request scheduling for decorated functions.

    The shutdown_throttle_funcs function is used to shutdown one or more
    function that were decorated with the throttle. The arguments apply to
    each of the functions that are specified to be shutdown. If timeout is
    specified, then True is returned iff all functions shutdown within the
    timeout number of second specified.

    Args:
        args: one or more functions to be shutdown
        shutdown_type: specifies whether to do a soft or a hard
                         shutdown:

                         * A soft shutdown (Throttle.TYPE_SHUTDOWN_SOFT),
                           the default, stops any additional requests from
                           being queued and cleans up the request queue by
                           scheduling any remaining requests at the normal
                           interval as calculated by the seconds and
                           requests that were specified during
                           instantiation.
                         * A hard shutdown (Throttle.TYPE_SHUTDOWN_HARD)
                           stops any additional requests from being queued
                           and cleans up the request queue by quickly
                           removing any remaining requests without
                           executing them.
        timeout: number of seconds to allow for shutdown to complete for
                   all of the functions specified to be shutdown.
                   Note that a *timeout* of zero or less is equivalent
                   to a *timeout* of None, meaning start_shutdown will
                   return when the shutdown is complete without a
                   timeout.

        Returns:
            * ``True`` if *timeout* was not specified, or if it was specified
              and all of the specified functions completed shutdown within the
              specified number of seconds.
            * ``False`` if *timeout* was specified and at least one of the
              functions specified to shutdown did not complete within the
              specified number of seconds.
